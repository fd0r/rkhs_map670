# New algorithms for large scale learning with kernels
RKHS project for the course "Generalization Properties" by Aymeric Dieuleveut

_Authors: Corentin Ambroise, Luis Montero and Margaux Zaffran_

## Set up

This repository requires python, but also needs some libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scipy
- scikit-learn
- jupyter
- googledrivedownloader
- os

If you need to install some of them, you can simply execute ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` on your terminal.

## Data

- ```MillionSongs``` can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yearpredictionmsd) ;
- ```CTSlices``` can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Relative+location+of+CT+slices+on+axial+axis) ;
- ```adult``` and ```census-house``` datasets have been downloaded from
[this website](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/datasets.html).
